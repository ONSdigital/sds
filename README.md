# Supplementary Data Service (sds)

More information on this service can be found on Confluence:

* https://confluence.ons.gov.uk/display/SDC/SDS

## Running locally

To run this service locally, you will need the following:

* Python 3.11
* VirtualEnv
* Docker

### Creating, activating and deactivating a Python virtual environment

Check that you have the correct version of Python installed and then run the following commands:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

This will create and activate the virtual environment. To deactivate the environment, run the following command:

```
deactivate
```

You can use another name for the virtual environment's directory if you wish but please add it to the `.gitignore` file.

### Installing the dependencies

Assuming that the virtual environment is activated, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Storing environment variables

Git is configured to ignore the `local.env` file. If you want to use another file to store environment variables 
then please add it to the `.gitignore` file. 

At the very least you need to include the following:

```
export FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID=localhost
export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8200
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=integration_tests/google_application_credentials.json
export FIREBASE_KEYFILE_LOCATION=firebase_key.json
```

Note that the `FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID` and `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variables match the settings in
the `docker-compose.yml` file. The other two are covered in a later subsection.

### Installing and running Firestore with Docker

In order to install the Firestore emulator, and assuming that you have Docker installed, run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d firestore
```

And to check that the container is running:

```
docker ps
```

To subsequently stop and start the container, run the following commands respectively:

```
docker stop firestore
docker start firestore
```

To delete the container once and for all, whether currently running or not, run the following command:

```
docker-compose down
```

The `docker` commands can be run anywhere. The `docker-compose` commands should be run from the repository root so that
the `docker-compose.yml` file can be found, unless you want to explicitly specify its path.

### Connecting to the Firestore instance

The Firebase emulator instance running inside Docker needs to be configured with default application credentials. These
are found in the `google_application_credentials.json` file in the `integration_tests` directory and the instance is
made aware of them by way on the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. The credentials are not meant to be secure,
see the following discussion: 

* https://groups.google.com/g/firebase-talk/c/IKo6PsXMqlQ

The credentials can be found here:

* https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python/blob/master/tests/data/service_account.json

There is a `scratch.py` file that can be run to check the connection to Firestore instance. Before running the file,
copy the default application credentials to a new file...

```
cp google_application_credentials.json firebase_key.json 
```
...and make sure the `FIREBASE_KEYFILE_LOCATION` environment variable is set to point to that file.

### Connecting to a remote Firebase instance

In order to create the requisite credentials, see here:

## Running linting and unit tests locally

To run all the checks that run as part of the CI, run the following commands:

```
black . --check
isort . --check-only --profile black
flake8 src integration_tests --max-line-length=127
export PYTHONPATH=src
pytest --cov=src src
coverage report --fail-under=90
```

To correct any problems that `isort` or `black` complain about, run the following:

```
black .
isort . --profile black
```

## Building and running on Docker

To build and run on docker, run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## OpenAPI Specification

As this runs in FastAPI, the Open API Spec and interactive API docs are auto-generated from the Python code and
can be reached by going to the following URLs (once running):

* http://localhost:8000/openapi.json
* http://localhost:8000/docs

## Running the integration tests

The integration tests can be run locally but don't currently work on a CI environment. Unlike the unit tests,
the integration tests require credentials to connect to a Firestore database. In the future, communicating with a 
real Cloud Firestore database could be replaced with https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/emulator for integration
testing purposes, which may also then open the possibility of running the integration tests in CI or folding them
into the unit test suit.

To run the integration tests, ensure you have a Firebase key file and then do the following:

```
cd integration_tests
export PYTHONPATH=../src
pytest
```
